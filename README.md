# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning with Python

## Overview

This project aims to build a predictive system in Python to determine whether a person has diabetes using machine learning techniques. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is utilized for this prediction task.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Import and Exploration
- The diabetes dataset is imported into the Python environment.
- Initial data exploration is conducted to understand the dataset's structure and contents, including summary statistics and visualizations.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- The dataset is cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Features are selected, and the dataset is split into features (X) and target variable (y).
- Data is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

### 3. Model Building
- A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is built using the training data.
- The model's parameters are tuned to optimize its performance and accuracy.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- The SVM model is evaluated using the testing data.
- Key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the model's effectiveness.

### 5. Prediction
- The trained SVM model is used to make predictions on new, unseen data.
- Predictions are compared with actual outcomes to validate the model further.

### 6. Conclusion
- Insights and conclusions based on the model's performance are summarized.
- Suggestions for potential improvements and future work are discussed.
